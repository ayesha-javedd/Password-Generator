**Password Generator in Python**

This Python script generates a random, secure password based on user-defined criteria. 

The user can specify:

âœ… The minimum length of the password

âœ… Whether to include numbers (0-9)

âœ… Whether to include special characters (!@#$%^&*...)

The script ensures that at least one number and one special character are included if the user selects those options. The password is randomly generated using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
